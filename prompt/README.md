### Role Play

在 [Awesome ChatGPT Prompts](https://github.com/f/awesome-chatgpt-prompts) 中：

> Human: Act as a Linux Terminal

Robot: 

> ChatGPT: I want you to act as a linux terminal. I will type commands and you will reply with what the terminal should show. I want you to only reply with the terminal output inside one unique code block, and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. My first command is pwd
